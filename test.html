<body>
<p>Hello All!</p>
<p>I am available to meet Monday - Friday 10:00pm to 11:59pm.</p>
<p>I may be able to meet by request at a different time. Please contact me at <link>cbement@student.cvtc.edu</link></p>
<p>My first elevator pitch is a Wordle Suggestion application.<br>
    This is helpful to people who would like a 5 letter word suggested to them.<br>
    I would call this Wordle Suggestions<br>
    This is an application that would suggest a 5 letter word to the user, depending on what is entered<br>
    Unlike a dictionary, this product would change the suggestion depending on the input.</p>
