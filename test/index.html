<h1>Casey Bement</h1>
<p>Hello All!</p>
<p>I am available to meet Monday - Friday 10:00pm to 11:59pm.</p>
<p>I may be able to meet by request at a different time. Please contact me at <link>cbement@student.cvtc.edu</link></p>
<p>My first elevator pitch is a Wordle Suggestion application.<br>
    This is helpful to people who would like a 5 letter word suggested to them.<br>
    I would call this Wordle Suggestions.<br>
    This is an application that would suggest a 5 letter word to the user, depending on what is entered.<br>
    Unlike a dictionary, this product would change the suggestion depending on the input.<br>
</p>
<p>My second elevator pitch is a PDF reader with custom color choices.<br>
    This is for people who read .pdfs.<br>
    This is helpful to people who would like to read pdfs in a certain color scale, dark mode or high contrast.<br>
    I would call this the PDF Color Changer.<br>
    This allows the user to set the exact colors of text and background.<br>
    Unlike Dark-reader, this product allows the colors to be chosen.<br>
</p>
<p>My third elevator pitch is a scaling visualization application.<br>
    This is for people who would like to visualize the size of a measurement.<br>
    This is helpful to people who would like to see an object in relation to a measurement.<br>
    I would call this For Scale.<br>
    This allows the user to enter a measurement and see an object that is that size.<br>
    Unlike a measurement, this product allows the user to visualize the measurement with an object.<br>
